frony0's .dotfiles
========

This is my $HOME. There are many $HOMEs, but this $HOME is my $HOME.

Specifically, this repo includes things like my dotfiles, vim configuration, i3 and conky setup, emacs scripts, and a selection of ~/bin scripts that I can feasibly publish without being sectioned under the Mental Health Act.

You are of course free to use any of these in any way, shape or form you wish where possible and sensible, but please do bear in mind that I have made negligible effort to make these remotely coherent or even functional as they stand, so good luck with that...

I did not write all of this. In fact I did not even write most of it. It would be generous to say I wrote some of it. My point is, I have forgotten where most of these are copied from, so if you see something you feel should be properly attributed then feel free to email me: frony0@gmail.com

This repo is managed by yadm as of 2019. Happy forking.
