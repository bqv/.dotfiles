My .dotfiles
========

Specifically, this repo includes things like my dotfiles, vim configuration, i3 and conky setup, emacs scripts, and a selection of ~/bin scripts that I can feasibly publish.

You are free to use any of these in any way, shape or form you wish, but do bear in mind that I have made negligible effort to make these remotely coherent or even functional as they stand, so good luck...

I did not write all of this, or even most of it. I have also forgotten where most of these are copied from, so if you see something you feel should be properly attributed then feel free to email me: me@fron.io

This repo is managed by yadm as of 2019. Happy forking.
